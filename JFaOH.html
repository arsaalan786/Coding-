        <p>We are living in this 21st century in this century the cities were very busy peoples don't have time to eat, sleep, & rest their day start with metros and trains & end In the Midnight. people's are harming their body because of their lifestyle. We all know that money is everything in this century but also Health Is Wealth.We should not have to compromise with our health</p>
        <p> Myself Arsalan welcome to my another blog let's started, today we will talk about our daily foods and meal routine. most of the peoples are live in cities for earning their needed income but unfortunately we forgot about what we are eating most of the people eat junk food nowadays. some eat homemade food but not all time. now we understand some scientific reasons of disadvantages of eating junk food. the food we eat have some nutritional values like calorie, protein, carbohydrate, fat etc. let discussed about each.</p>
        <p>First "calorie" it is energy of our body. if we do anything like if you walk 20 metres calorie wil burn and if you will intake more calorie then required then the rest of the calorie will convert into mass and if you will intake less calorie then required the body burn your fat and lose weight so intake calorie by your body need to maintain weight.second "protein" it is used to make muscles it is the most important nutrition of our body. third is "carbs" and Carbohydrate and fourth is "fat" you can learn more about this on internet.</p>
        <p>Let return to our topic junk food has many calories but their nutritional values like protein, carbs is low and they are rich in fat so the intake of junk food make you fatty and energy less and if you intake homemade food you will be maintain your weight, build muscles and become happy so if you are worried about your health take a decision now that you should never eat junk food if you applicable to eat homemade food and if you out of home eat fruits in the place of junk food. thank you for reading my blog if you like it subscribe my blog for notification and daily updates</p>
