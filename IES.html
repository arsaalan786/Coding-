            We all know well about education and the benefit of being educated but today I am going to tell you the truth about the education our education System and the solution or what you have to do. myself Arsalan I am 11 standard student this is my first blog and I wanted to share what's wrong thing empowered me to wrote about this.

            The word "education" is understood by Indian's as "success" An ordinary middle class parents spend up to 10 to 50 lakh on education of their child but they don't know the truth behind the institute. The current market value of the coaching industry in India is RS 58000 crore. all the parents want that their child will become an engineer doctor etc. approximately 26 lakh student appears in JEE and NEET intrance exam every year. But why every hour one student commits suicide in India. More than 70% engineer are Unemployed in India. why India should worry about its educated but unemployed youth
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer is the worst Indian education system. we all know the conditions of our government school but private school also have the worst faculty. private school charges high fees but hire the cheap payment teachers. most of the private school is open as the purpose of business. Because of very high Unemployment, teacher were ready to teach on the low payment and they don't have much potential to teach better because he also learn from the Rote Learning education system. They tick the answers on books and said, Write and Learn it 10 times and the student complete his 10 + 2 education by this rote learning system.
        </p>
        <p>
             now, students also get used to rote learning and just want passing the exam they don't want learning about their field. they just want passing exam and getting job and because of this a large number of educated youth get unemployed because they don't have knowledge about their field. only skillful student gets jobs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            as per my opinion Government have to focus on the new startups and our education policy. The learning of creating job by building a company company were given to the students in school. The huge old syllabus will be replaced by a new syllabus. now, student have to focus more on learning skill not in passing exam because degree is just a piece of paper the real education is what you learn. Parents have to become friendly to their children and make them what they want. I hope the future of India will be the better thank you for reading my blog I hope you will understand and like this blog thank you again.
